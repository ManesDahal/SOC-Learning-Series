## What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team that **monitors, detects, analyzes, and responds** to security threats in an organization.

**Purpose:**
- Detect threats  
- Analyze suspicious activity  
- Respond to incidents  

This is achieved through **People, Processes, and Technology** working together.

## SOC Types

1. **In-House SOC** – Managed internally, full control, requires a long-term budget.  
2. **Virtual SOC** – Remote monitoring, cloud-friendly, flexible.  
3. **Co-Managed SOC** – Internal team + external MSSP, balanced control.  
4. **Command SOC** – Central SOC overseeing multiple smaller SOCs.

## People, Process, and Technology

- **People:** Skilled analysts familiar with threats.  
- **Process:** Procedures, compliance, and escalation paths.  
- **Technology:** Tools for detection, prevention, analysis, and response.

## SOC Roles

- SOC Analyst  
- Incident Responder  
- Threat Hunter  
- Security Engineer  
- SOC Manager  

Each role is critical for defending organizations from cyber threats.
